# judge-mark-average

This was a university assignment that I recently completed. 

Goal of the project was to have the user select a number a judges (between 4 and 8) with data validation and then enter the marks for x amount of judges - program then removes the lowest and highest element and displays the average result of the remaining marks.

Fully written by me!

Any pointers or tips or feedback would be appreciated.

Cheers,

Jake
